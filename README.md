# Welcome
This page presents to you the most complete projects made during my training at BeCode in reverse chronological order.\
These projects were made entirely by Arthur Dorchies and used Figma for design resources.\
Keep in mind that these are training exercises for specific techniques, and only the targeted features are meant to be complete.
